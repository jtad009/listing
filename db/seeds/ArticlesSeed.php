Buffett and Marks are the types of investors who can, themselves, move the markets, and for that reason, every choice they make is closely scrutinized by average investors trying to make smart decisions.</p>

<p>During times like these, when the markets have been seesawing up and down and the short-term outlook is uncertain, it can be even more tempting than usual to watch what successful and wealthy investors do and to look to them for guidance or reassurance.</p>

<p>So it may be comforting to learn that the people with the most money at stake are, in large part, sticking to the basics. Many wealthy investors are doing two things, data shows: They&#39;re staying in the market, and they&#39;re continuing to make contributions through the crisis.</p>

<p>1. Wealthy investors are staying in the market Even as the stock markets dropped 34% at the end of February, many people with money in the markets held fast. Overall, 80% of investors stayed the course during the market volatility in the first quarter, according to data from Bankrate.</p>

<p>Those plans haven&#39;t changed. Among wealthy investors, about half (47%) plan to keep their portfolios at roughly the same level in the next six months, meaning that they&#39;ll continue to buy and sell investments at their normal rate, and 37% plan to invest more, according to the quarterly UBS Investor Sentiment survey published at the end of April. The survey collected answers from almost 3,000 investors with at least $1 million in investible assets.</p>

<p>While the UBS survey indicates wealthy investors aren&#39;t as optimistic about the market as they were at the start of the year, it also shows that many are sticking to the strategy most financial professionals recommend: Buy, hold, and stay invested for the long term.</p>

<p>The donations cut across infrastructural support to providing opportunity for free tests across different locations and financial support to the federal government in partnership with the Nigerian Private Sector Coalition Against COVID.</p>

<ul>
<li>The sum of N250 million was donated to support the federal government&rsquo;s effort to curtail the spread of the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) in the country and end the epidemic.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Also, in furtherance of its focus on not just the health sector but the healthcare professionals who risk their lives while treating infected persons, <a href="https://sterling.ng/giving/">the Bank has supported</a> crowdfunding platform, <a href="https://giving.ng/covid19.php">Giving.ng</a>, to raise a N1billion Health Workers Fund to cater to the needs of health workers at the frontlines taking care of those infected with the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The Bank donated N25million to kickstart the fund. It will enable corporations, institutions and individuals in Nigeria and the diaspora support healthcare workers and reward them for their sacrifice and bravery.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>In addition to this, the Bank also supported the country&rsquo;s first COVID-19 drive-thru mass mobile testing center with an initial investment of N10million. This was done in partnership with Life Bank and the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research (NIMR) to make testing easier and faster. This reduces the burden of testing on the Nigerian Center of Disease Control (NCDC) and the risk of contagion of the disease due to ignorance of infected persons. The investment will be scaled up as the project expands to different locations across the country.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>To strengthen public health infrastructure, the Bank donated N50million for the equipping of the COVID-19 Isolation ward at the National Orthopedic Hospital, Igbobi, Lagos in partnership with Fate foundation philanthropy to cater to the increasing COVID-19 confirmed cases.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Bank will continue scaling efforts to mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic and promote a healthy society for the country.</p>

                'article' => '<p>In Lagos, of the numerous problems we face, overcrowding and accommodation wahala are the biggest. The ratio of people to amenities results in endless struggles. From power supply to water supply to the roads (don&rsquo;t get us started on the famous Lasgidi traffic &ndash; it&rsquo;s our own Anthony Joshua vs Ruiz fight and unfortunately poor infrastructure is the winner beating the rest of us black and blue.)</p>

<p><strong>Many health problems can be directly attributed to the overcrowding, which generally affects waste management, drainage pollution) systems and general environment friendliness.</strong></p>

<p>The affordability of quality housing in the state especially is questionable as construction experts substitute quality for quantity in a bid to reduce costs eventually resulting in many cases of collapsed or sunken buildings; one of the most recent being the Ita-Faji, Lagos Island collapse which happened on March 13th and claimed over 20 lives. By 2050, the population of Lagos is<br />
expected to double once more, which will make it the 3rd largest city in the world. With less infrastructure than any of the other megacities, our struggles may well continue like Arsenal&rsquo;s trophyless European activities.</p>

<p>With people on the streets and many others spending a larger part of their income on rent, the result is simple &ndash; a loss of&nbsp; productivity and economic hardship.</p>

<p><strong>Relative Affordability</strong></p>

<p>Affordability is a largely relative concept determined by various factors but most importantly by ego. As of February 2019, the annual minimum wage stood at N216,000. Since experts have told us that, we spend about 60% of our income on food, it means only about N84,000 is available for housing among minimum wage earners.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the annual cost of a low service apartment in Lagos is estimated at N150,000. If you&rsquo;re a family man or woman with dependents, you would still need to cover clothing or pay school fees(although Sterling Edu-finance has got you covered).</p>

<p><strong>There is also the factor of location- the costs of a threebedroom flat in Yaba and Ipaja would differ greatly. A person who desires to pay the premium of living in a central, developed commercial hub like Yaba would pay much more than someone in Ikorodu would.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Lasgidi Efforts</strong></p>

<p>Between 2011 and 2018, Lagos State government reportedly allocated N390bn to the Housing and Community services for different housing projects in the state. Major strategies were implemented to achieve higher housing inclusion such as direct construction of houses on a massive scale, which reduced the perennial shortage of housing particularly for lowincome groups. While there have been different special reforms and housing schemes orchestrated by the government, the root causes of the housing problem have not been addressed.</p>

<p><strong>Affordable housing is really a global problem so much that Nelson Mandela once said, &ldquo;When a man is denied the right to live the life he believes in, he has no choice but to become an outlaw.&rdquo; The mismatch of housing to people in Lagos has led to an increase in price because of the high demand to supply ratio which has caused an availability crisis. There is also the increasing case of fraudulent people who pose as house owners to rip desperate individuals of their hard-earned money for house rents, brethren say God forbid! There has been an increase in the violation of property laws and thanks to our &ldquo;agile&rdquo; judicial system; it might just continue to worsen.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Way forward</strong></p>

<p>Dear government, let the private sector help. While the onus is on you to get sustainable funding and also to maintain the policy environment required to make building easier &ndash; (e.g. the 19 different payment points for building is a bit ridiculous!), involving the private sector will allow the solutions scale quicker.</p>

<p><strong>Dear private sector real estate developers, re-think housing design to accommodate more Lagosians at affordable prices.</strong></p>

<p>Dear Lagosians, good luck!<br />
We will overcome our homelessness</p>

                'article' => '<p>For the first time in weeks, my house is quiet.</p>

<p>I just have one kid but when the schools were shut down, I inherited three more because my friends were health workers and needed to social distance from their children. Who would have thought that a time like this will come?</p>

<p>My wife and I find ourselves screaming every morning before work which we now do from home. But in all the constant shouts and headaches, which lead to the plenty sugar pumps (may the dentists not chop our heads with fees post-covid), WE FOUND A WAY!</p>

<p>We understood that the chaos was because this situation is new to all of us. I mean, it&rsquo;s weird that they can&rsquo;t see their best friends and teachers and won&rsquo;t even be able to visit them for God-knows-how-long.</p>

<p>So, take it easy on them. Here&rsquo;s how we made it work so far.</p>

<p>First,&nbsp;<strong>a little dose of sunshine hurt nobody.&nbsp;</strong>We try to get them to bathe like they are actually going to school and we all go outside before breakfast. Vitamin D is still essential and in those moments, we break down our schedule for the day. We also hear from them how school was the previous day and if they would need our help too. Don&rsquo;t forget they&rsquo;re helping you by shutting up, so, you need to make them know that you can be of help too.</p>

<p><strong>They take the dining table; we take the living room.</strong>&nbsp;That way, we can supervise without disturbing. We also made sure that their lunch break and ours coincide so that we can keep tabs on each other. We try to give them the same snacks like school times so it feels almost the same. Use your breaks too; it applies on site and with remote working.</p>

<p><strong>Set boundaries.</strong>&nbsp;You can start off with, &lsquo;knock and if the door is locked, know I&rsquo;m on the phone&rsquo;. Make them understand that if you lose your job, they won&rsquo;t buy the games, dresses and sweets, of course. Sometimes, I take calls on speakerphone just so they remember this and they comply.</p>

<p><strong>Reward.&nbsp;</strong>Most behaved of the day gets something that they like. For now, it&rsquo;s been yoghurt or more snacks than the rest or even increased screen time. Children love to be paid for obedience just like you love to be appreciated by your boss!</p>

<p><strong>Reassess yourself.</strong>&nbsp;I had to stop measuring productivity by number of work hours but by volume of tasks accomplished. That way, I could get stuff like writing, calculations and research done in the early hours of the morning or late at night when they are asleep while I reply mails during TV time or while helping out with assignments.</p>

<p>Above all, remember that they would disturb like children that they are but the goal is to get them to be quiet for much longer. Therefore, you need to make them feel like they are in school. You can work with their friends&rsquo; parents to schedule video calls for them to catch up after school while you put those hours to work.</p>

<p>If you found these helpful, feel free to leave a comment below and share these tips by a Nigerian couple.</p>

                'article' => '<p><strong>Imagine a world without electricity? Without it, our lives would be radically different, and in almost every instance a whole lot harder. Regrettably, access to electricity for Nigeria&rsquo;s over 100 million rural inhabitants is estimated at 36% while it is almost 60% for urban dwellers.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>It is not surprising that the World Bank has ranked Nigeria as the second largest country in the world after India and the first in Sub-Saharan Africa with the highest number of people deprived of electricity. Ironically, electricity generation started in Nigeria in 1896 with her first electric utility company established in 1929.</p>

<p>As it stands, between 500,000 to 800,000 new households would have to be connected to electricity sources every year between now and 2030 for the country to achieve her target of universal access to electricity for all its citizens.</p>

<p>Certainly, life without electricity is tortuous and has been aptly described as living in the dark. It deprives excluded people or communities every basic comfort and fuels migration. For instance, residents of Unguwar Dogo, a village in northern Katsina, travel 40 minutes to another village to charge their mobile phones. This community is limited to the use of traditional sources of energy such as firewood, animal dung, and crop residues for heating and cooking which are effective causes of harmful indoor air pollution.</p>

<p><strong>In contrast, access to electricity improves the quality of life and accelerates development of rural communities by enabling access to safe potable water, improved sanitary and health conditions, food security, as well as lighting and information. Access to electricity is not only critical for improving living standards but regarded as indispensable for eradicating poverty.</strong></p>

<p>To bridge the country&rsquo;s gaping electricity deficit estimated at more than 20 million homes, Sterling Bank Plc has identified renewable energy as an alternative form of energy which can be easily and conveniently delivered to millions of Nigerian homes, small, medium and large enterprises in both urban and rural areas.</p>

<p>Affirming this, Abubakar Suleiman, Chief Executive Officer, Sterling Bank, disclosed that the bank has committed itself to be at the heart of Nigeria&rsquo;s accelerated development by focusing on five critical sectors of the economy namely Health, Education, Agriculture, Renewable Energy and Transport. Taking the first letters of these sectors, one is pleasantly surprised to see them form the word HEART. Abubakar calls these five critical sectors, the HEART of Sterling.</p>

<div style="text-align:center">

</div>

<p>According to the Bank Chief, Nigeria&rsquo;s power problem affects businesses and communities, and must be solved to ensure quality life for all citizens as well as accelerated economic development. He believes that resolution of the power problem through decentralized renewable energy solutions will lead to rapid industrialization, job creation, quality education and healthcare delivery, among many other benefits.</p>

<p>The Bank&rsquo;s three-pronged approach to achieving this are financing, trading and partnerships. It has set aside funds for large projects that provide electricity to communities and businesses. From the trading perspective, it is creating a platform that enables the sale of renewable energy solutions between electricity generators, distributors and users. Finally, Sterling Bank is creating partnerships to encourage the flow of foreign investments into the renewable energy space in order to bridge the service gaps which currently exist in market.</p>

<p>Remarkably, the Bank has signed an agreement with the Kaduna State Government, Kaduna Business School and Blue Camel Energy to deliver a renewable energy solution called &lsquo;Solar-fi hub.&rsquo; The hub was developed by a start-up incubated by the Kaduna Business School.</p>

<p>Dr. Dahiru Sani, Rector, Kaduna Business School, said the mini accelerator project was created to improve access to electricity with the invention of Solar-fi hub as outcome. &ldquo;The Solar-fi hub is powered by solar energy to meet the day-to-day needs of the average citizen who may want to listen to news, watch football matches, or boil water for domestic use&rdquo;, Sani disclosed.</p>

<p>According to the Rector, the Solar-fi hub can be used by farmers in rural communities to power grinding machines and water pumps for irrigation while also bridging small power needs like charging of phones in homes where there is no power. He added the partnership between the Kaduna Business School, Blue Camel Energy and Sterling Bank to deliver the Solar-fi hub will improve the quality of life and earning potential of rural dwellers.</p>

<p>Commending Sterling Bank for believing in the renewable energy dream, Yusuf Suleiman, Managing Director, Blue Camel Energy, said solar energy is the future of electricity in developing countries. He added that Blue Camel Energy is laying the foundation for the democratisation of electricity to homes, businesses and schools ensuring that they can generate their own cost-effective electricity using solar energy.</p>

<p>Yusuf disclosed that Blue Camel Energy initiated and completed its assembly plant and academy within eight months. The plant has the capacity to assemble over 10,000 units of clean, affordable and reliable solar products in a year while the academy has the capacity to provide energy entrepreneurship training to about 3,000 youths within the same period.</p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;We are ready to lead in solving energy-related problems across different sectors of the economy. So far, we have invested over $1 million and would be investing another $5 million in the next 24 months to ensure delivery of solar-generated power to factories&rdquo;, Suleiman informs.</strong></p>

<p>Similarly, Sterling Bank partnered with Zola Electric, a for profit social enterprise, to make distributed renewable energy accessible to Nigerians businesses and households in need of constant and clean power supply. Adaptable to energy need and income, Zola&rsquo;s renewable energy solutions can be easily accessed through consumer finance from Sterling Bank.</p>

<p>Chief Executive Officer, Zola Electric, Mr. Bill Lenihan said the company has studied the Nigerian electricity market and figured out a way to proffer lasting solution to the country&rsquo;s electricity needs. &ldquo;Our solutions are designed to solve every level of the energy access problem. And while financing has been identified as one of the key limitations for consumers to acquire renewable power solutions, our partnership with Sterling Bank ensures access to product finance for interested customers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Despite the commitment of Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) to stimulating investment in renewable energy, little progress has been made in the sector. Existing investments in power grids built on fossil fuels keep players tied to costly and pollution inducing energy sources regardless of the obvious advantages of renewable energy solutions.</p>

<p>However, all of this might become a thing of the past considering Sterling Bank&rsquo;s commitment to bridging the funding gap hitherto faced by would-be adopters of renewable energy solutions. This indicates that Nigeria will eventually tap the potential of its abundant renewable energy resources for socio-economic benefits.</p>

<p>International development agency, Oxfam, believes renewable energy solutions are more reliable, effective and affordable for poor people in developing countries who do not have access to electricity. This is especially true for northern Nigeria where the electricity grid does not extend to remote areas and the distances between villages are significant. Apart from being generally clean and pollution-free, renewable energy sources are sustainable natural forms of energy which require less maintenance than traditional generators.</p>

</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Truly so, renewable energy facilities are more suitable for community management and ownership because they can be set up in small units. By investing heavily in renewable energy solutions, Sterling Bank is lighting Nigeria&rsquo;s path to development. It is apparent that the bank has its HEART in the right place.</p>

                'article' => '<p>Successful investors like Warren Buffett or Howard Marks have prophet-like status to many people. Buffett and Marks are the types of investors who can, themselves, move the markets, and for that reason, every choice they make is closely scrutinized by average investors trying to make smart decisions.</p>

<p>During times like these, when the markets have been seesawing up and down and the short-term outlook is uncertain, it can be even more tempting than usual to watch what successful and wealthy investors do and to look to them for guidance or reassurance.</p>

<p>So it may be comforting to learn that the people with the most money at stake are, in large part, sticking to the basics. Many wealthy investors are doing two things, data shows: They&#39;re staying in the market, and they&#39;re continuing to make contributions through the crisis.</p>

<p>1. Wealthy investors are staying in the market Even as the stock markets dropped 34% at the end of February, many people with money in the markets held fast. Overall, 80% of investors stayed the course during the market volatility in the first quarter, according to data from Bankrate.</p>

<p>Those plans haven&#39;t changed. Among wealthy investors, about half (47%) plan to keep their portfolios at roughly the same level in the next six months, meaning that they&#39;ll continue to buy and sell investments at their normal rate, and 37% plan to invest more, according to the quarterly UBS Investor Sentiment survey published at the end of April. The survey collected answers from almost 3,000 investors with at least $1 million in investible assets.</p>

<p>While the UBS survey indicates wealthy investors aren&#39;t as optimistic about the market as they were at the start of the year, it also shows that many are sticking to the strategy most financial professionals recommend: Buy, hold, and stay invested for the long term.</p>

                'article' => '<p>What if I told you that some businesses have bloomed as a result of the COVID-19? This is a truth that entrepreneurs need to embrace now in order to psyche themselves up for action.</p>

<p>At first, it was almost impossible to admit this because of the pain that the pandemic brought with it but coming &lsquo;up close and personal&rsquo; with quite a number of entrepreneurs during the lockdown made me realize that advancement can still happen amidst adversity.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 will expose the world to three kinds of businesses, not necessarily by any fault of theirs. First, those that were hit pretty badly economically and closed shop as a result. The second set are the survivors who pulled through and are trying to find their feet but the third are the subject of this article. They are the ones who through the trial, were able to think through their business models and do what is known today as&nbsp;<strong>&lsquo;repurposing&rsquo;</strong></p>

<p>What does this mean? For instance, Emeka is a professional chef but because of the ban on events and public gatherings, he will not be able to cater for outdoor activities. But his skill is innate and won&rsquo;t go anywhere but may be redundant if he does not seek other avenues to stay afloat. So what can he do?</p>

<p>Emeka can decide to sulk all day and blame the government or explore other ways to express his skill while remaining relevant to his clients. He could reach out to them and suggest food delivery services since most of us are still working remotely. He could also write a cook book, featuring some of his notable recipes. He might as well orgainize &lsquo;cook with me&rsquo; sessions on social media as an authority building exercise and eventually host online classes for newbie event businesses and chefs, alongside some of his colleagues in the industry.</p>

<p>Same person, same skill, different streams of income.</p>

<p>Entrepreneurs need to realize that there was a reason they did not take up jobs in the corporate world in the first place. Those reasons could range from the love for freedom to a knack for risk and so on but these are tested in times of abnormality like this one. When things don&rsquo;t seem to go as planned, it is business owners who do not prove themselves worthy of the CEO title that will go into extinction because like it or not, this menace is launching a new wave of innovative businesses.</p>

<p>The Post-Covid era will be a classic case of innovate or die.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So if you are a venture of any magnitude; small, medium or big, it&rsquo;s time to repurpose your services as that is the fastest way to expand during this crisis, retain your customer base and acquire new &lsquo;family members&rsquo;.&nbsp; Technology has afforded us this opportunity as the world has now become a global village where resources are sold across borders.</p>

<p>Wake up and smell the coffee. Look at your business and think through other ways within which you can &lsquo;style&rsquo; that particular craft that you are known for. Research what global competition have or are doing and tailor it to the market in your region. For specifics, you can start with surveys to your present clientele; there might be things they need that you can offer and because you&rsquo;ve been working with them, they trust you to deliver.</p>

<p>Take advantage of that trust and scale.</p>

                'article' => '<p>When we came up with&nbsp;<strong>CafeOne</strong>, our co-working space where entrepreneurs can utilize the power supply and internet services in exchange for buying a cup of coffee, it was a banger because the turn up was lit. Till date, we have helped tons of businesses thrive amidst the challenging times by just allowing us to make them any coffee of their choice.</p>

<p>This time, we are back with an adaptation of this same project for the growing fashion businesses in our midst. One of the challenges of this sector is access to machines that aid production and that is exactly what the Business Hub has come to solve.</p>

<p>At the Business Hub, the best machines for sewing, weaving, finishing, name it, have already been acquired and set up just so that you can walk in and sew your time away on any of our machines all day long. The pressure to get yours is off your shoulders, for now.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" height="427" src=" https://sterling.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/TBH4-768x512.jpg" width="641" /></p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t even stress if you cannot sew; you can come along with your preferred tailor to piece together your sketches. It even helps you plan in such a way that you can sketch and cut for certain days of the week and sew on other days.&nbsp;The beautiful part is that there are vendors there to &lsquo;feed&rsquo; you if you&rsquo;re hungry. Not for free o because you feed yourself when you&rsquo;re in your shop, right? So, consider this your shop, LOL.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anyways, you can also be one of our vendors, in case you&rsquo;re not a fashion designer but want to make some money off this initiative. All you need is a&nbsp;<strong>Sterling Business Account</strong>&nbsp;and you&rsquo;re good to go. This is our way of thanking our customers for sticking with us through thick and thin. An amazing thing is that in case you&rsquo;ve sold for the day and you can&rsquo;t rush to the bank to deposit, you can do so in the within the building. Cool, right?&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" height="435" src="http://localhost:8020/img/passport/blogs/Doubble-a8467.png" width="580" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Did I mention that we also have well-furnished meeting rooms? Rooms that have a splash of afro-centricity, from the fabrics on the furniture to beautiful handcrafts, exquisite flowers, paintings or woven pieces on display, which could also be sold to you based on demand? So, you don&rsquo;t just get to host your meet-and-greet or train your staff or have a client consultation session in a professional environment that is void of food aroma or messy toilets or people loitering and being all up in your business; you get to window-shop or shop and pay for items through the alternative finance store called&nbsp;<strong>Altmall</strong>.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" height="454" src=" https://sterling.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/TBH5-768x512.jpg" width="605" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>All these in just one space and you get access, how? Simple; Just make sure that your breakfast or lunch or any sort of refreshment for the time you&rsquo;re scheduled for will be purchased from the vendors within the building. That&rsquo;s your &lsquo;gate-fee&rsquo;; NO RENT! NO LIGHT BILLS! NOTHING but your lunch money.</p>

<p>See you at the Adebola House, 23 Opebi Road, Ikeja, anytime from 8 am to 5 pm daily, excluding Sundays.</p>
